The laptop comes with a modest 1.6 Ghz Intel Celeron CPU with 2GB of RAM and 32 GB of eMMC storage. While there are smartphones that are faster than this budget laptop, for children the good keyboard and the nice trackpad will go very far in helping them work on school projects and network with their classmates. The laptop\\u2019s small 11-inch screen makes the device extremely portable and it also comes with all of the ports needed for online classes (like the 3.5mm headphone jack). The webcam on this device is pretty bad with just a 360p sensor, but it gets the job done. The device will definitely be slow, but at this range and for this price, it\\u2019s one of the better options. The 32 GB of storage will also be kind of problematic if you plan to store anything more than documents on the device but there are models with higher storage capacities for a slightly higher price if you want to opt for more storage. Acer A515 Price: Rs 44,990 For a slightly higher price than the Lenovo, the Acer A515 is a surprisingly powerful device. The laptop comes with a budget-friendly Intel Core i3 processor with 4GB of RAM and 1 Tb of HDD storage. The laptop is also bigger with a sizable 15.6-inch display but is relatively thin-and-light too. Unfortunately, while the internals may be good for the price, on the external side of things, the laptop does have a cheap feel to it with an all-plastic design with a few strips of aluminum to spruce things up. The keyboard and touchpad on the Acer is also pretty good, typing on the device feels great and the touchpad also comes with Windows Precision drivers so they\\u2019re pretty accurate and smooth to use. The webcam is better than the Lenovo with a 720p HD sensor but it\\u2019s not very impressive either. Regardless of its shortcomings, the Acer A515 offers pretty decent specifications for the price. The device should handle Zoom with ease and run productivity apps like Word, PowerPoint and Excel pretty well. Acer Aspire E15 Price: Rs 50,000 The Acer Aspire E15 is no looker. The laptop is all black plastic and is thick and bulky to boot. While the brushed metal texture of the plastic and a few metallic trims here and there try to spice up an otherwise plain design, the chunky plastic build of the device looks really cheap. So why am I recommending this horribly built together laptop? Well, what it lacks in aesthetics, it makes up in performance. If you don\\u2019t really care about what the laptop looks like, then at 50k you\\u2019re getting an 8th Gen Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM and a dedicated AMD Radeon 520 GPU. The 256GB SSD is not really that impressive when it comes to capacity but the SSD alone will speed up the system quite a bit. The webcam, as with all the entries above, is not very good, while the sensor is quite good at capturing detail the overall colour and noise is terrible. Decent webcams in budget laptops do seem to be hard to find, but connectivity wise the laptop comes with almost everything including an 8x DVD drive. So, the laptop is a decent one if you consider everything that comes bundled with it even though it does look horrendous. HP 14 Price: Rs 60,500 With a considerable bump in the price, we come to the HP 14. The HP 14 comes in various different configurations but we\\u2019re talking about the one with the 10th Generation Intel Core i5 with 4GB RAM and 256GB NVMe M.2 SSD. While the RAM definitely needs a bump up, which a few extra bucks would get you, the 4GB would be enough for daily use. The 10th Generation Intel CPUs also come with the Intel Iris Plus Graphics which while being an integrated GPU is plenty powerful to run some Adobe Applications. Running Microsoft\\u2019s Office Suite should be a breeze. The keyboard and touchpad on this device are really good and HP even advertises a TrueVision HD Webcam with dual array digital microphones, which is honestly bad. The webcam is horrible at colour accuracy and even the contrast ratio is quite disappointing with lighted areas being completely bloated out. While the webcam definitely underperforms, the dual array microphone is a pleasant addition. The sensitive mics are great when on a conference call or while attending online classrooms. The laptop houses a 14-inch display with 1080p FullHD resolution that should ensure the display is sharp, unfortunately the colours seem a bit dull. The HP 14 isn\\u2019t perfect but it is small and compact and offers some powerful performance. Hunting down a decent budget laptop can be very tiring, tedious and difficult since laptop prices seem to keep going up constantly. While all of the laptops recommended here are brand-new, you might also consider looking for a good second-hand, older laptop for more performance.  Understandably, second-hand laptops will raise a whole host of new concerns and issues, but smart shopping can yield very good results too. If the CPU and motherboard are good, you might even try buying cheap machines and updating the RAM and storage on your own too.\",\n          \"Sabitra Bhandari scored her 53rd international goal on Tuesday, becoming the leading women\\u2019s goal scorer of South Asia. Bhandari, popularly known as Samba, created history during the 2024 WAFF (West Asian Football Federation) Women\\u2019s Championship semi-final match against Lebanon when she scored the equaliser in the 76th minute at the Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal Sports City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In the process, Bhandari eclipsed India\\u2019s Ngangom Bala Devi\\u2019s record for most international goals by a South Asian woman footballer. Devi previously held the record with 52 goals to her name. Bhandari is in the 31st position, alongside Austria\\u2019s Nina Burger, in the list of top international women\\u2019s football goal scorers. Bhandari is also the all-time highest goal scorer in Nepalese football history. Bhandari also leads the WAFF Championship goal tally with nine goals. Bhandari\\u2019s equaliser set the tone for Nepal\\u2019s semi-final triumph as Preeti Rai scored a last-gasp winner to send Nepal into the final. Nepal, who are making their first appearance in the tournament, will face three-time defending champions Jordan in the final on Thursday. Jordan won the last three editions (Jordan 2014, Bahrain 2019 and Jordan 2022) of the biennial international women\\u2019s football competition. However, Nepal will be without Bhandari in the title clash as the final match does not fall under the FIFA Window dates. \\u201cCurrently representing EV Guingamp in France, Sabitra contract with the club permits her to represent her country in competitions and tournaments held during FIFA window dates. While the group stage and semi-final matches of the WAFF Women's Championship fall within the February 19-28 FIFA Window, the final on February 29 does not align with this timeframe. Consequently, according to her contractual obligations, Sabitra is not obligated to participate in the final match,\\u201d All Nepal Football Association said on its Facebook page. \\u201cWe want to clarify that Sabitra will not be available for selection in the national team for the final against Jordan,\\u201d ANFA added. \\u201cWhile we acknowledge the disappointment this may cause among our fans and understand Sabitra's absence will undoubtedly be felt, we want to reassure our fans that the team is fully prepared and committed to stepping up in her absence. Every member of the team is ready to rise to the occasion and fill the void left by Sabitra's absence.\\u201d\",\n          \"Nepal Sports Journalists Forum (NSJF) on Sunday announced that the 20th edition of the NSJF Pulsar Sports Award 2079 will be held on January 26 in Kathmandu. Organising a press conference, NSJF also extended the sponsorship deal with Hansaraj Hulaschand and Company (HH), the authorised distributor and producer of Bajaj Pulsar motorbikes in Nepal. NSJF president Durga Nath Subedi (Devendra) and HH executive director Abhimanyu Golchha penned the sponsorship deal. As per the agreement, HH will provide five N Series Pulsar motorbikes to NSJF that included two N250 and three N160 two wheelers. The motorbikes will be rewarded to the players and coaches. In addition to the motorbike, HH will also provide a purse of Rs1.2 million to NSJF, the umbrella organisation of sports journalists in the country. This is the 15th year in a row that HH has been sponsoring the annual Sports Award which began in 2003. NSJF will award players and sportspersons in eight different categories at the award ceremony on the basis of their performance in the past Nepali calendar year (2079 BS). The categories include male, female, coach and youth player of the year, peoples\\u2019 choice award, lifetime achievement award, para athlete honour and special award. HH executive director Golcha said that the investment of the private sector was essential for the development of the sports sector of the country. \\\"Moreover, Pulsar as a brand is associated with sports and youth. It is a matter of pride for us to be associated with NSJF because they have always set a new standard, be it in stage set up or performance. It has been a flagship event for us,\\\" he added. NSJF president Subedi praised HH for their continuous support despite the sluggish economic condition of the country. He added that NSJF was planning to change the format of the award this year. \\\"We are planning to shift the venue from Nepal Academy Hall and it will be revealed in a few days,\\\" said Subedi. A players' selection committee formed by NSJF will reveal the nominees for player of the year male, female, youth, coach and peoples' choice award. The committee will pick the winner of four categories\\u2014male, female, youth and coach\\u2014the winner of the peoples' choice award will be decided through eSewa votes, Facebook likes and points allocated by NSJF members and chief coaches of sports associations. The winners of the five categories will be rewarded with motorbikes. There won't be nominations in other categories\\u2014para athlete, special and lifetime achievement awards. The winners will be directly revealed during the award ceremony and they will be feted with a purse of Rs50,000 each. Apart from this, NSJF will also honour international sports journalists with the Asian Sports Journalist Award. Footballers Anjan Bista (male) and Manish Dangi (youth), volleyball player Aruna Shahi (female), Abdullah Almutairi (coach) and volleyball player Usha Bhandari (peoples' choice award) were the winners in the respective category last year. Couple Dan Bahadur Tamang and Maya Devi Moktan, the parents of national badminton champions Ratnajeet, Sara Devi and Nangsal Devi Tamang were feted with the special award. Palesha Goverdhan of taekwondo earned para athlete award, Olympian Raghu Raj Onta lifetime achievement award and Mohommed Hiji of Qatar was the winner of Asian Sports Journalist Award.\"\n        ],\n
